# IW4X Scripts
A collection of small GSC-only mods that work in a self-contained manner.
These **do not modify base game files**, which makes them modular and compatible
with lots of other mods.

These scripts are built with IW4X in mind and (some) may use engine functions
that do not exist on other clients.

## Installation
Drop the mods from the `scripts` folder into `IW4X/userraw/scripts`.
It is possible to only include some scripts. Always provide `scripts/_utility.gsc` though.
