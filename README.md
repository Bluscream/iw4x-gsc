# IW4X Scripts
A collection of small GSC-only mods that work in a self-contained manner.
These **do not modify base game files**, which makes them modular and compatible
with lots of other mods.

These scripts are built with **IW4X** in mind and may use engine functions that do not
exist on other clients.

## Installation
Drop the mods from the `scripts` folder into `<IW4X>/userraw/scripts`.
It is possible to only include some scripts. However you should always install the `_` (underscore)
prefixed files!
